class WestCoastRobot(commands2.TimedCommandRobot):
    """
    We've created a "WestCoastRobot" class to express all of our robot code to
    WPILib. This class has a number of different methods, each representing
    different phases of booting up the robot and progressing through match gameplay.

    WPILib strongly follows object-oriented programming principles, and one such
    principle we see here is inheritance. "Inheritance" is when one class brings
    in the data attributes and methods of another. For example, if we make a
    class to represent a mammal and say that a mammal is warm-blooded, then when
    we make a class to represent a dog and inherit from the mammal class,
    the dog will also be warm blooded.

    Here, our robot class inherits from a generic timed robot class that we
    brought in from the commands2 part of the RobotPy ecosystem. Any robot
    built off of this timed robot class will execute code based on an internal
    clock that ticks on a fixed interval. We'll explore this more later when we
    start looking at autonomous routines.

    def robotInit(self):
        """
        The code in robotInit is executed as soon as the robot is powered on or
        when new code is deployed. It is typically used to set up virtual
        representations of physical aspects of the robot, like motors, drivetrains,
        sensors, and much more!

        When creating instance attributes, we'll use self.<attribute_name>
        syntax. This lets us create data elements within a specific object.
